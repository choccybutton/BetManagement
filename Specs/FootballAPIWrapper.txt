From this create a C# wrapper that exposes the full functionality of the API in as simple a way as possible. All entities should be available to consumers of the wrapper. 

The wrapper should track the usage statistics made available through the api headers in responses to the API.

The API key and address should be configurable by consumers of the wrapper.

Create the wrapper in a folder of it's own to keep it separate to the rest of the application we are working on.

Also create a simple React based web interface that allows all functionality of the wrapper to be tested.
