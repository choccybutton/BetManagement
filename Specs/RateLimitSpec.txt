The Football API is a paid service. There are daily and per minute limits to the requests available to use.

The following values are returned in the headers of each request response to allow tracking of usage -

x-ratelimit-requests-limit: The number of requests allocated per day according to your subscription.
x-ratelimit-requests-remaining: The number of remaining requests per day according to your subscription.
X-RateLimit-Limit: Maximum number of API calls per minute.
X-RateLimit-Remaining: Number of API calls remaining before reaching the limit per minute.

You can also get the statistics from the status endpoint.

We should capture this data and store it locally. In the header of the dashboard we should show the percentage of daily use that has been used.
